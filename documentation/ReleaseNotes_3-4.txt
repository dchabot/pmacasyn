Compared to 3-3, release 3-4 is basically a bug fix. The only updated
part is pmacApp/src where a long-standing bug from the initial 1996
implementation has been finally nailed down and fixed. The bug related
to improper mutexing was causing pmacMbox task to crash occasionally,
especially under high IOC load.

------------------------------------------------------------
New features introduced in the 3-3 release:

1) added get_enum_str() function to the statusRecord.c.
this allows to query BI00-BI31 fields of the status record for debugging.
examples:

ioc1>dbgf "23d:CCD:ml:SvoSts.BI16"
DBR_STRING:          ON
value = 0 = 0x0
ioc1>

gmca@px0:/home/gmca 1 > caget 23d:CCD:ml:SvoSts.BI16
23d:CCD:ml:SvoSts.BI16         ON
gmca@px0:/home/gmca 2 >



2) improved DPRAM-ASCII part of the PMAC driver by removing
unnecessary queue from drvPmacMbxTask() in the drvPmac.c.
Epics record get processed by the drvPmacMbxTask(), this eliminated
errors with intermixing PMAC responses under higher IOC load.


3) improved efficiency of pmacAscReadMeISR() in the pmacDriver.c
- replaced two VME bus reads of byte size by one of uint16 size,
- removed useless line at the end of pmacAscReadMeISR:
  control = getReg( *dpramAsciiInControl );

4) added support for ACC-59E in the file devPmacMbx.c. Currently the supoort
corresponds to the bipolar configuration of DAC only.
