<H2><CENTER>Steps to prepare Turbo PMAC VME working with EPICS</CENTER></H2>

<p>This document describes how to setup Turbo PMAC VME working with the
EPICS system implemented at four sectors (19:SBC-CAT, 18:Bio-CAT, 23:GMCA-CAT,
21:LS-CAT). These groups use a set of standard EPICS records (ai, ao, bi, bo,
calc, fanout) interacting with each other in order to achieve flexible mapping
into EPICS of the complex PMAC functionality where one deals with coordinated
motions of 1,2,3,4,... and etc motors. This extensive set (about 100 records
per motor at GMCA-CAT and LS-CAT and considerably more in the older systems
used at SBC and BioCAT) is introduced instead of a single
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/motor/">Motor
Record</a> per motor because the latter is not flexible enough to map the PMAC
coordinated motions, choice of motion programs and etc. For those who still
want to try Motor Record with PMAC, respective driver support is included
in pmacApp/pmacAsynMotorSrrc.</p>

<H3>Step-1: Setup all motors in PEWIN32</H3>

<ul COMPACT>
<li>Check all limit switches
<li>Tune all motors
</ul>

<p>This step is a pre-requisition because EPICS support is built on top of
tuned, working motors. The tools to tune motors in EPICS are rather limited.
That is why even after the EPICS support is built and made operational, you
will still need to have PEWIN around and the possibility to connect the PC
with PEWIN to the PMAC serial console. In most case the two systems (EPICS
and PEWIN) can be used simultaneously.</p>

<H3>Step-2: Prepare PMAC for VME communications</H3>

<p>This part is described in a <A HREF="VME_bus_setup.html">separate document</A>.</p>

<H3>Step-3: Prepare PMAC to work with EPICS</H3>

<p>Set the following I-variables:</p>

<table border>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td> I1=0   </td><td> Serial port mode = CS handshake used</td>
</tr>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td> I2=3   </td><td> Control panel = disable.</td>
</tr>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td> I3=2   </td><td> I/O Handshake Control: PMAC acknowledges valid command
                       with "ACK" and invalid with "BELL" Messages are sent as
                       DATA  ... DATA .</td>
</tr>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td> I4=0   </td><td> Communications Integrity Mode: checksums disabled; serial
                       errors are reported immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td> I6=1   </td><td> Error Reporting Mode: the error message format is
                       {error message}.</td>
</tr>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td> I7=9   </td><td> Phase Cycle Extension: number of consecutive cycles to
                       detect "In-position".</td>
</tr>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td> I9=0   </td><td> Full/Abbreviated Listing Control: the programs are sent
                       back in short form; decimal-address I-variable return.</td>
</tr>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td> I58=1  </td><td> DPRAM ASCII Communications Enable = yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td> I68=15 </td><td> Coordinate System Activation Control: (number of PCS)-1.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<H3>Step-4: Map your PMAC coordinate systems</H3>

<p>Produce with text editor a file pcs.pmc (see examples in pmc/2_ioc-specific).
The file will look like:</p>

<pre>
; (1) WS:Av:
&1
#1->X  ; WS:mt:
#2->Y  ; WS:mb:

; (2) WS:Ah:
&2
#3->X  ; WS:mo:
#4->Y  ; WS:mi:

; (3) VC:Vz:
&3
#5->X ; VC:mz1:
#6->Y ; VC:mz2:
#7->Z ; VC:mz3:
</pre>

<p>... and etc. Then, using the script called <B>mapDPRAM.pl</B> produce the two files
m3300.pmc and q70.pmc mapping PMAC DPRAM for these coordinate systems. Load
all three files into PMAC using PEWIN32.</p>


<H3>Step-5: Load motion programs</H3>

<p>Load into PMAC the set of motion programs from pmc/3_motion-prg. The set
contains 9 basis programs for the coordinate systems of 1,2 and 3 motors:</p>

<ul compact>
<li>SLEW: move motor(s) from A to B
<li>BACKLASH: move motor(s) from A to B with backlash
<li>POSITION: move motor(s) from A to B and perform backlash compensation for
	     one direction only.
</ul>

<p>These operations conclude preparing the PMAC communications and PMAC DPRAM.</p>


<H3>Step-6: Edit EPICS DB loading templates</H3>

<p>Now, prepare EPICS databases for loading. In many cases no database development
is needed because the provided set has DBs for a number of common coordinations
like slits, double-crystal monochromator, mirrors. 3-point tables, and etc.
Locate examples in the iocboot directory and analyze the files st_pmac.cmd
and EPICS templates in the dbLoad subdirectories. Start with assy.AssyGeneric
and edit the files one by one. These templates are self-explanatory: they
contain comments on what offsets should be used to properly map PMAC DPRAM
access at the EPICS DB side.</p>

<p>Note that in the current setup the communication with assembly of 1 motor
requires 5 addresses of DPRAM, communication with assembly of 2 motors
requires 8 addresses of DPRAM, and communication with assembly of 3 motors
requires 11 addresses of DPRAM. Only those databases that reside in pmacDB
communicate with PMAC. The databases in softDb serve common DB interaction
and locking and the databases in the other directories are specific for a
given coordination (slits, mono, mirror, and etc).</p>

<p>Finally, locate pmacApp/opi/tcl and edit file configXX.tcl (where XX stand
for the beamline name). This file will contain the information about
configuration of PMAC motors loaded into IOC in order to call the right MEDM
screens.</p>

<p><B>Some DB naming conventions:</B></p>

<table border>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td><nobr> prefix: </nobr></td><td> use something like 23i, 23o, 23b, 18ID,
            and etc. for the beamline name prefix.</td>
</tr>
<tr VALIGN="top">
 <td><nobr> pmac names: </nobr></td><td>use pmac10, pmac11, pmac12,... for PMACs
           in IOC1 and pmac20, pmac21, pmac22,... for PMACs in IOC2.
</tr>
</table>

<H3>Step-7: If you need to design a new type of motor assembly</H3>

<ol compact>
<li>take one of existing assemblies with the same number of motors as
   a template and edit respective 5 files:
   <ul>
       <li>XX_calibtate.db -- assembly calibration parameter (scale factors,
                          offsets, and etc)
       <li>XX_LimAmp.db -- propagation of limits switch signal from individual
                       motors to combined axes
       <li>XX_Tsub.db -- service around the transformation routine (tsub) mapping
                     requested axes positions into requested motor counts
       <li>XX_TsubRbk.db -- same in the backward direction
       <li>XX_TsubSpeed.db -- same for motors speed propagation.
    </ul>
<li>take an existing tsub routine from pmacApp/tsubSrc, tweak and name it
   accordingly, and add the tsubSrc Makefile.
</ol>
