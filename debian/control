Description: Libraries for working with Delta Tau Turbo PMACs within EPICS.
 This library contains the low-level PMAC communication support
 (pmacAsynIPPort), and Motor Record device support (pmacAsynMotor and
 pmacAsynMotorPort). Note, support for working with Delta Tau
 coordinate systems is now packaged separately (pmacCoord).
 .
 This package contains files which may be used to run IOCs controlling 
 Ethernet-based Delta Tau Turbo PMACs using the synApps Motor Record 
 and pmacasynmotor.
