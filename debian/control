Description: Libraries for working with Delta Tau Turbo PMACs within EPICS.
 This library contains the low-level PMAC communication support 
 (pmacAsynIPPort), and Motor Record device support (pmacAsynMotor and
 pmacAsynMotorPort). Note, support for working with Delta Tau
 coordinate systems is now packaged separately (pmacCoord).
 .
 This package provides shared libraries.
