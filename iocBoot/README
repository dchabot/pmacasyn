For more IOC boot examples see these 6 directories:

/synApps/xxx_gmca23.../iocBoot

The 6 examples correspond to three GM/CA CAT beamlines at Sector 23 of the APS.
Each beamline has two VME IOCs: IOC-1 controls beamline optics and IOC-2
controls beamline endstation. Five of these IOCs contain two Turbo PMAC2
UltraLite boards and one (xxx_gmca23i_ioc1) contains only one Turbo PMAC2
UltraLite board.
