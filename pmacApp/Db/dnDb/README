These are BioCAT downstream support databases. Two downstream support motors
in the coordinate system provide downstream height and angle as combined motion.
The databases are similar to those of the mirror support with the difference
that the center or rotation is not in the middle between the two motors, but
at a remote point defined by the RotOrigin distance. See DN_Calibrate.db and
CalibDNSt.adl for more details.
