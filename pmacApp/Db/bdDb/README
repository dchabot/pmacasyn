These are GMCA beam delivery databases. They are similar to BioCAT downstrieam
support databases except for the the fact that positive angles correespond to
moving up and the RotOrigin distance is measured between the center of rotation
and closest motor. Motor-1 is downstream; motor-2 is upstram. Two motors in 
the coordinate system provide delivery deviation at the centre of rotation and 
angle as combined motion.
The databases are similar to those of the mirror support with the difference
that the center or rotation is not in the middle between the two motors, but
at a remote point defined by the RotOrigin distance. See BD_Calibrate.db and
CalibBDSt.adl for more details.
