These are databases for Double Crystal Monochromator (DCM) energy with three
motors and angular offset dependent on the white-beam angle. They correspond 
to a constant-exit-height monochromator of GMCA CAT BM beamline and similar
to that of BioCAT ID beamline (when setting the angular offset to zero) with
the exception that motors 2 and 3 have reversed sense.

The motions of the rotary motor and the second crystal X-Y translations are 
mapped into mono energy and wavelength or back. The transformations use the
monochromator d-spacing as a parameter. The translations of the second crystal
can be turned off. See MO_Calibrate.db and CalibMOEn.adl for more details.
