These are databases common for different assemblies. They are grouped in the
"pmac" directory because all of them talk to PMAC hardware either through
PMAC mailbox (ASCII driver) or dual-ported RAM (DPRAM driver).

NOTE: if you plan to use PMAC motors with Scan Record in the step-scan mode,
then substitute AssyGeneric.db with AssyGeneric_scanrec.db and bkgfix1pcs.db
with bkgfix1pcs_scanrec.db or otherwise scan record will not wait for motion
to execute.
