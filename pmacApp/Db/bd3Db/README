These are databases databases for vertical support of GM/CA-CAT beam delivery:

dsSt provide coordinated motions for 3-motor beam delivery support at GM/CA-CAT.
The three motors are lined along the beam pass, but the bellows have certain
flexibility so that the construction is not always a straight line.

The coordinate system consists of 3 motors:
- one upstream vertical slide that should keep the upstream part of the
  pipe roughly pointing it to the point where the x-rays are reflected
  from the mirror -- i.e. the beam should enter the center of the pipe
  at the upstream location.
- two downstream vertical slides supporting the goniometer platform. The
  interplay between these two defines the vertical tilt of the platform
  along the beam and the height of the sample position.
