These are databases for Double Crystal Monochromator (DCM) energy with two
motors. They correspond to a constant-exit-height monochromator with vertical
translations of the second crystal at energy scans (at Bragg angle changes).
The longitudinal translation of second is not included into those databases
(see BioCAT-type mono for example with longitudinal translation included).
The motions of the rotary motor and the second crystal translation are mapped
into mono energy and wavelength or back. The transformations use the
monochromator d-spacing as a parameter. The translation of second crystal
can be turned off. See MO_Calibrate.db and CalibMOEn.adl for more details.
