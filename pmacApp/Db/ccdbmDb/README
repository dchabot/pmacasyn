These are databases for CCD detector at GM/CA BM line:

CCDSt provide coordinated motions for 3-motor CCD detector support.
The coordinate system consists of 3 motors:
- one horizontal slide (detector motion along the beam)
- two vertical slides (upstream and downstream) defining
  detector angle 2*Theta and keeping detector face perpendicular
  to the X-ray beam.
See more details in file "detector_equations_Sergey.ppt"
and in files CCDSt_Calibrate.db and CalibCCDSt.adl.

The only difference of these eqations from the CCD support at the GMCA
ID lines is the exclusion of vertical focusong mirror angle, since the
BM line beam should travel horizontally (the reflections for white beam
mirror and the vertical focusing mirror should compensate each other).

CCDLp is a 1-motor assembly providing lateral motion of CCD detector.
It is not present here because a standard XPs (X-positioner) is used
(which is again different from the ID lines).
