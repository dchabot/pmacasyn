These are Shutter Motor databases  -- nearly the same as X-positioner or
modular drives (one motor in coordinate system). The only diffrence is
that they output binary statusflag "shutter open/close".
See SH_TsubRbk.db, pmacDb/shutter.db, and CalibSHPs.adl for
more details.

Comments from shutter.db and SH_TsubRbk.db:

### This DB is for a fast endstation shutter that is a
### fast motor controlled by PMAC. This motor should be
### controllable from both EPICS and directly from PMAC
### (the later is needed for precise synchronization of
### shuuter with gonio head).
### For this shutter we have two motion programs "prgOpen"
### and "prgClose" that read the shutter destinations from
### DP:"DPopen" and DP:"DPclose" respectively. Then, the
### shutter readback Tsub assignes the shutter status $(m1)bo:rbk
### to be either "Open" or "Close" depending on whether the
### shutter motor current position is closer to $(m1)OpenPos
### or $(m1)ClosePos.
