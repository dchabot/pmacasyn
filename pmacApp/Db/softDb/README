These are databases common for different assemblies. They are grouped in the
"soft" directory because they do not talk to any PMAC hardware.

NOTE: if you plan to use PMAC motors with Scan Record in the step-scan mode,
then substitute AssyGeneric.db with AssyGeneric_scanrec.db and bkgfix1pcs.db
with bkgfix1pcs_scanrec.db or otherwise scan record will not wait for motion
to execute.
