These are XY-positioner databases. The coordinate system consists of two
independent motors with common start and stop. See XY_Calibrate.db and
CalibXYPs.adl for more details.

The only reason to combine two independent motors into one assembly is to
have a common control and to reduce the number of coordinate systems. The
matter is that the Turbo PMAC2 Ultralight can drive up to 32 motors, but not
more than 16 coordinate systems. Therefore, one cannot assign all motors
independently. For motors not included into coordinate systems the only
possible motion operation would be jogging, i.e. no motion program (e.g.
backlash) could be executed.
