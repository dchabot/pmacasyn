These are databases for CCD detector:

CCDSt provide coordinated motions for 3-motor CCD detector support.
The coordinate system consists of 3 motors:
- one horizontal slide (detector motion along the beam)
- two vertical slides (upstream and downstream) defining
  detector angle 2*Theta and keeping detector face perpendicular
  to the X-ray beam.
See more details in file "detector_equations_Sergey.ppt"
and in files CCDSt_Calibrate.db and CalibCCDSt.adl.

CCDLp is a 1-motor assembly providing lateral motion of CCD detector.
It is very similar to MDCs (Modular Coordinated System) with the
exception that the calibration takes into accound coordinate system
shift due to reflection from mirror.
