This directory contains a TSUB Record (Transformation Subroutine) source code
and a collection of associated transformation subroutines for PMAC working
through this TSUB record.

TSUB is a general-purpose EPICS record providing a way to run user-written
transformations in the IOC. The aim of TSUB is to fetch some input values
through TSUB record "input" DB links, to perfom a transformation according
to respective transformation subroutine (a user-supplied C-program) and to
push the output values into the "output" DB links. The name of user-supplied
subroutine is specified in the TSUB record SNAM field. TSUB record provides
80 input DB links and 70 output DB links, which should be sufficient for most
needs. By its versatility, it stands between EPICS Sub (subroutine) Record
and aSub (Array Subroutine) records included into EPICS Base, although it was
developed well before aSub. In principle, aSub can be used anywhere instead
of TSUB, privided one converts respective subroutines written for TSUB and
replaces the TSUB DB fields with aSub fields.

A typical use of TSUB records with PMAC is to map from e.g. actual motors
positions into axis positions or from requested axis mosition into requested
motor position. For example, when one specifies desired monochromator energy,
a TSUB record and the associated subroutine tsubMOEnAxs (see tsubMO.c) are
used to map the value into desired monochromator rotary and monochromator
second crystal translation positions.

The transformation routines in this directory are grouped as one file per
assembly type. So, when one adds a new PMAC motors assembly type (e.g. an
XYZ translation stage), he has to write a new tsubXYZ.c file by analogy
with other assemblies.

As  TSUB is a soft record, it is independent of PMAC and VxWorks and can be
compiled for e.g. Linux IOC (since the 07/2011 version) and deployed for
other types of calculations.
