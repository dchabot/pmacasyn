These are TCL/TK based GUI to call all PMAC-related MEDM screens. The
three examples correspond to the three GM/CA beamlines at the Sector
23 of the Advanced Photon Source (APS).

Usage:           ./23b.tcl
                 ./23i.tcl
                 ./23o.tcl

One has to modify respective configXX.tcl file according to the names
of loaded PMAC-related databases (see the iocBoot directories).

Also file config.tcl has to be updated with the locations of
external programs like medm and xterm (in the attached version
everything is assumed to be in the system path).
